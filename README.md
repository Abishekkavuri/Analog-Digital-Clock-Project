# Analog-Digital Clock Project

This project implements a dynamic clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock represents the hours, minutes, and seconds with stacked numbers, where:

- **Hours** are represented with 3 stacked numbers.
- **Minutes** are represented with 5 stacked numbers.
- **Seconds** are represented with 7 stacked numbers.

The clock runs smoothly and rotates continuously without reversing or resetting after 60 seconds.

## Features

- **Dynamic Clock**: Updates in real time to display the current hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Stacked Numbers**: The numbers representing time are stacked vertically for each hand.
- **Continuous Rotation**: The second hand rotates clockwise without resetting after 60 seconds.
- **3D Design**: Stylish, 3D-like circular clock with attractive visuals.
- **Fully Responsive**: Fits any screen size.

## How It Works

1. The clock fetches the current time using JavaScript's `Date` object.
2. Each pointer (hours, minutes, and seconds) rotates based on the calculated angle:
   - **Hour Hand**: Moves 30 degrees per hour.
   - **Minute Hand**: Moves 6 degrees per minute.
   - **Second Hand**: Moves 6 degrees per second.
3. Stacked numbers are dynamically updated based on the current time.
4. The second hand continues to rotate clockwise seamlessly without resetting.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the clock.
- **CSS**: Styling and positioning.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for time updates and rotation.
